## 1 - Create a Contact List API
Create a REST API using libraries like json-server, or mock libraries of your choice, which
will store people and their contacts. A person can have multiple contacts, such as phone,
email or whatsapp.
### How to Run
`json-server --watch .\server\db.json`

## 2 - Contact List Frontend
Create a web app which explores the API built in the second assignment. You are expected
to use Angular, TypeScript, Angular CLI and SCSS. The UI design is totally up to you.

### How to run
`cd contact-list`

`npm install`

`ng serve`
